\section{Admissibility of Cut}

\begin{theorem}[Cut]
  If $\sequent{A}$ and $\sequent[A]{C}$ then $\sequent{C}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  Suppose that we have the derivations
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\prf{D}$ for $\sequent{A}$ and
    \item $\prf{E}$ for $\sequent[A]{C}$.
  \end{enumerate}
  We need to construct a derivation $\prf{F}$ for $\sequent{}{C}$.
  We consider the following six cases.

  \paragraph{Case: $\prf{D}$ is an initial sequent.} In this case
  $\prp{A}$ must be some atomic proposition $\prp{P}$ and $\prf{D}$
  must have the form
  \[
      \begin{prooftree}
        \infer0[init]{\sequentHat[P]{P}}
      \end{prooftree}
  \]
  So $\Gamma = (\widehat{\Gamma}, \prp{P})$ which implies that $\prf{E}$ proves
  $\sequentHat[\prp{P}, \prp{P}]{C}$. From this, it follows by contraction
  that $\sequentHat[\prp{P}]{C}$ and then since $\Gamma = (\Gamma, \prp{P})$,
  it is the case that $\sequent{\prp{C}}$.

  \paragraph{Case: $\prf{E}$ is an initial sequent that uses the cut formula.}
